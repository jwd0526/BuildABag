const results [][];
for each type of club
	for each manufacturer
		submit form
		for each "conformingContainer"
			for each "conformingRow" except the fifth
                if its the last conforming row 
                    get the third child element's child (an image) and take the src value
                else
				    get the "conformInfo"

Each club should look like this:

[
    {
        type: // from the clubtype loop
        manufacturer: // from the first "conformingRow"
        productName: // from the second "conformingRow"
        loft: // from the third "conformingRow"
        clubNo: // from the fourth "conformingRow"
        pre2010: // from the 6th "conformingRow"
        2010: // from the 7th "conformingRow"
        imgLink: // from the src value of the 1st child of the third child of the 8th "conformingRow"
    }
]

This is an example of getting the image from the first "conformingContainer":
document.querySelectorAll("#conformingContainer > :nth-child(8) > :nth-child(3) > :nth-child(1)")[0].getAttribute("src");

This is an example of getting the data for the manufacturer name from the first conformingContainer:
document.querySelectorAll("#conformingContainer > :nth-child(1) > :nth-child(2)")[0].textContent.trim(" ")
